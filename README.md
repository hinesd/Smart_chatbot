A project that we chose that would give us more experience with python, javascript, and html.

in this project the team chose to use flask as the web framework, and, for testing, we used postgre databases to store data

The goal of the project is to create a help window that will connect clients/customers to an agent for any issue they have. 
the implementation we currently have is very crude and the sole purpose was for testing, as we didnt get to the stage of being 
able to integrate sockets.
